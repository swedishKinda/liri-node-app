# Liri Node App
This is an app simalar to Siri but instead of speaking commands they are typed into a console.

# Problem
Make a node app where the user can search for a song on Spotify, movie on IMDB, or for a concert on Bandsintown. All must be done in the terminal.

# Solution
Made a js file with api calls and console logs.

# Tech
- API calls
- Console logs
- Inquirer npm
- Spotify npm
- Axios npm
- Moment npm
- Fs npm
- Dotenv npm

# Getting Started
Click on green button "Clone or download" and copy link. Run a "git clone {link}" in [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/ "Git bash download page")(PC) or Terminal(Mac).

enter in "cd" space "name of app" and then run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install all necessary node modules.

After installations are completed run the following command:

```
node liri.js
```

# Instructions
Enter your name. Pick which option you would like to try. Follow instructions listed in the app. FYI you will have to re-enter "node liri.js" after you run a function, I will be working on making it more streamlined so it will send the user back to the main menu.

# Prequisites
Have node.js installed.
