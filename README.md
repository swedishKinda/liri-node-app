# Liri Node App
This is my first node.js application.

# Problem
Make a node app where the user can search for a song on Spotify, movie on IMDB, or for a concert on Bandsintown. All must be done in the terminal.

# Solution
Made a js file with api calls and console logs.

# Tech
- API calls
- Console logs
- Inquirer npm
- Spotify npm
- Bandsintown npm
- IMDB npm
- Axios npm
- Moment npm
- Fs npm
- Dotenv npm

# Instructions
First clone or download the repo. Then open a console program of your choice and navigate to the root file. Then enter in "node liri.js" into your console and the app will give you all the instructions you need. FYI you will have to re-enter "node liri.js" after you run a function, I will be working on making it more streamlined so it will send the user back to the main menu.

# Getting Started
If you want to edit this code. Just open any of the files and copy-&-paste the code into any coding program of your choice, perform a git clone, or download straight from github.

# Prequisites
Have node.js installed.
